 # E-commerce Website â€“ HTML, CSS, JavaScript
This project is a basic front-end e-commerce website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website allows users to browse products, view product details, add items to their cart, and search/filter products based on categories.


 # How It Works
1. Homepage
Displays all available products with details like name, price, and image.
Navigation bar includes links to Home, Category, Search, and Cart pages.

2. Category Filtering
Users can filter products by categories such as Electronics, Clothing, and others.
Clicking on a category displays only the relevant products.

3. Product Details Page
When a user clicks on a product, they are taken to a page with detailed product information, including a description, price, and rating.

4. Search Functionality
A search bar allows users to search for products by their name.
As the user types, matching products are dynamically filtered and displayed.

5. Shopping Cart
Users can add products to their shopping cart.
The cart page shows a list of added products, including their quantity, price, and total price.
Users can adjust the quantity or remove items from the cart.
